# 430Project1
This is a program that accepts a ppm file and stores the data of the ppm in a pixel data buffer struct. It also writes ppm files(p3 and p6) when given a pixel data struct.
Although I didn't get it to work completely I got it to where I had no errors when compiling, and my logic in the code seems sound, I had changed a lot of the code back and forth trying to figure out what was going wrong and I've ran out of time to continue to "spaghettify" my code as the deadline is approaching. I think that I had most of my problems with just figuring out what exactly you wanted to happen with the program but the email adding extra clarity helped. I got confused with the pointers to the structures and if I should be just calling the structure immediately or use a pointer to the structure and use the -> operator instead of the dot operator. I can not figure out why my code stops executing as I have ran it through an ide and no errors pop up it just either crashes or continues to run. I had success when checking whether it was p3 or p6 at the top of the file and then going to seperate conditionals but after that it seems to stop working, maybe fscanf was where I went wrong when I should have used fgetc the entire time. I would have came into office hours but I had no time and started to work on the project too late.
